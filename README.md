Speech to Text Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension allows you to convert spoken words into text and then insert the text into the active input field of the current web page. The extension takes advantage of the Web Speech API for speech recognition and is compatible with most input fields, including <input>, <textarea>, and content-editable <div> elements.

Features

Click the extension icon or press Alt+, to toggle speech recognition on and off.
Microphone icon in the lower-right corner of the web page for easy access, which also displays the current status of speech recognition (red when active, black when inactive).
Continuous speech recognition mode that restarts automatically when it stops.
"That's All" keyword: When you say "That's all" (regardless of case), the extension will automatically submit the input (equivalent to pressing Enter).
Supports English language input.

Usage

Click the extension icon or press Alt+, to start speech recognition, or click the microphone icon in the lower-right corner of the web page.
